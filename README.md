Coremod for the Gregwolves modpack

The standard Gradle run command will not necessarily help here; since I don't know of a way to smoothly integrate
Tectonic and its configs into the Gradle setup such that the mixin refmap Tectonic is missing is accounted for, the
Tectonic-based changes will not be visible/correct here. It's being tested in the actual modpack.
